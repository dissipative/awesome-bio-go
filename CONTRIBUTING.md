# CONTRIBUTING.md

Thank you for improving this list.

## Maintenance policy

This list is curated. The main list includes actively maintained projects that we can recommend. Archived or removed
projects belong in [ARCHIVED.md](ARCHIVED.md). Move entries after 12+ months of inactivity or if a project is
explicitly archived/removed.

Last full audit: 2026-02-02.

## Audit checklist

- Confirm the repository is reachable and not removed.
- Check whether the repository is archived.
- Update the description to match the repository summary or README.
- Move archived/unmaintained projects to [ARCHIVED.md](ARCHIVED.md) with a short status note.
