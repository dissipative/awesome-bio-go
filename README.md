# (Awesome?) List of Bioinformatics Software Written in the Go Language

There are several reasons why there isn't as much software written in Go for bioinformatics. The primary reason is historical —
Languages like Python and R have historically been popular in the bioinformatics community due to their ease of use,
extensive libraries, and strong community support.
Many existing bioinformatics tools and workflows are already written in these languages,
making it easier for new projects to build on top of existing solutions.

Despite all the challenges, Go's simplicity, performance, and concurrency support could make it
a viable option for certain bioinformatics applications, especially those that require efficient multi-threading
or that need to be deployed as standalone binaries. As Go continues to grow and gain traction in various industries,
it's possible that we'll see an increase in the number of bioinformatics projects written in the language.

A quick search on the internet, especially on GitHub, has shown me that a lot of work has been done in this direction in the last decade.
Starting from the classical "all-in-one bio package" _biogo_, which seems to have been abandoned in recent years, several enthusiasts continued to
expand the code base and created more and more tools, mainly for molecular data manipulation.

I want to especially emphasize two developers and researchers: [Wei Shen](http://shenwei.me) from the Institute for Viral Hepatitis, China and
[Brent Pedersen](https://github.com/brentp), a genomicist from the Netherlands — most of the libs and tools in this list were made by them.
I haven't had enough time yet to check all the items on the list, so I anticipate that it will change (be extended or refined) in the near future.
